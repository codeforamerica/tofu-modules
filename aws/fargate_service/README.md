# AWS Fargate Service Module

This module launches a service on AWS Fargate. It creates a cluster, task
definition, service, and container repository. In addition, it creates the load
balancer, ACM certificate, Route53 records, and security groups needed to expose
the service.

## Usage

Add this module to your `main.tf` (or appropriate) file and configure the inputs
to match your desired configuration. For example:

```hcl
module "fargate_service" {
  source = "github.com/codeforamerica/tofu-modules/aws/fargate_service"

  project       = "my-project"
  project_short = "my-proj"
  environment   = "dev"
  service       = "worker"
  service_short = "wrk"

  domain          = "dev.worker.my-project.org"
  vpc_id          = module.vpc.vpc_id
  private_subnets = module.vpc.private_subnets
  public_subnets  = module.vpc.public_subnets
  logging_key_id  = module.logging.kms_key_arn
  container_port  = 3000

  environment_variables = {
    RACK_ENV = "development"
  }
}
```

Make sure you re-run `tofu init` after adding the module to your configuration.

```bash
tofu init
tofu plan
```

To update the source for this module, pass `-upgrade` to `tofu init`:

```bash
tofu init -upgrade
```

    description = "Example credentials for our application."
  }
}
```

| Name                   | Description                                                  | Type     | Default | Required |
